### Hi there I'm Emily Weston ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack software developer currently residing in Southwest Florida. I have experience in Python, C#/.NET, and Javascript (MERN). I have 5 years of experience in mortgage lending and technical training, ran my own freelance web and graphic design business for the last 7 years, graduated with my software development certificate from Coding Dojo, and have a Bachelors in Elementary Education with additional endorsements in Reading and ESOL! 

I'm passionate about building accessible applications to meet the needs of people and the businesses they love. I believe that as software developers we can use clean code and intentional design to create experiences people will remember and that improve their daily lives!
